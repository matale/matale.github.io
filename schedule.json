Unfortunately, the fickle nature of UI interaction during development, test flakiness, and user scenario permutations make this difficult to achieve. This is particularly the case in mobile app development due to a large number of device configurations (including OS versions, device form factors, and device manufacturers).                    We all know that it's important to begin testing for issues as early as possible. Yet the great challenge to 'shifting left' is that UI automation takes time and requires skilled engineers to build who are in short supply in this job market.                Using a combination of no-code/lowcode approach, seamless CI integration, and built-in resiliency to reduce flakiness, we can make this a viable approach that is less costly or time-consuming. We will discuss pros and cons of various approaches (scripting, low code, nocode) to solving this problem and delve into one that we have pioneered in Sofy.",

We will highlight the good practices on how to decouple modules, how to loosely connect modules together, which traps to avoid and common sources of module coupling with their solutions.\nWe will factor into our modularization strategy a ‚Äúcost of module‚Äù, which is not neglectable and balance that against the benefits modules bring. We will look for good modules and bad modules to optimize and make sure that all modules bring positive value.\nThe talk will show how to measure and automatically identify problematic modules and its dependencies paths within our module graph to enable prioritizing whilst incrementally improving the graph.\nObserved impact on the metrics of build time, contributions across teams, cost of modules and more will be shown. Insights will be shared on how to convince the organization to invest engineering time into modularization and how to synchronize the effort across teams from different departments. Modularization is treated and prioritized as a business enabler rather than just engineering.\n                   The modularization journeys keep showing that if we invest effort, the return of that investment can come back soon.

You can, for example, place a phone call from the command line.\n            At an even lower level, we have native services. These are Unix daemons that are started during early boot. You can list them, start and stop them, and even restart the Android run-time.\n            Next, file permissions: what prevents an app or service from accessing a file? This is a story of Unix file permissions and SELinux policy. I will show how you can see the permissions and the policy, and change them - but only if you have root access.\n            Finally, I will look at system properties.

Those frames can be manipulated, modified, beautified in any manner before previewing or recording it.\n            You can even add your custom views like static images or even 3D face mask or any 3D object in the preview after detecting objects like the face in frames. This entire process is called rendering objects in camera preview frames.\n            Not only rendering, but we can also apply various filters like Sepia, grayscale and many more before previewing each frame.         These all features can be utilized in any android app using OpenGL.\n            \n            how a view or camera frame is drawn on the screen?\n            What is OpenGL?\n            how OpenGL controls GPU rendering?\n            What are vertex and fragment shaders?\n            How do they affect the camera frame and preview?\n            How can we modify the camera frames between camera APIs and previewing?\n            What all can we do with that?\n            \n          Well, let's get all these questions answered in the talk along with our experiences and challenges we've faced.",

            "desc": "A cold-blooded war is raging on Android between ‚Äúwhat users can do with their devices‚Äù and ‚Äúhow much their device lasts on one charge‚Äù. Each new Android OS version is less merciful to your background processes. Different OEMs kill your apps straight away without asking whether you do something useful for your users or not. New weapons of mass destruction are being invented year by year. Their names? Doze mode V1!, Doze mode V2!, Background restrictions!, Adaptive battery! and more are coming this year whose evil names are yet to be known. But we can already imagine their devastating powers.\n           \n            Some OEMs are more cruel than others. The darkest warlords of them all? Samsung, Huawei, OnePlus and Xiaomi in that order. They employ elite trained assassins called app killers whose insidious ways are yet to be documented.\n            \n            It seems impossible to survive, but there is hope. A small group of relentless developers (let‚Äôs call them the Resistance) gathered around a project called dontkillmyapp.com. They have risen up against the evil hordes of pkill -9. They have years of experience with long running processes and alarms on Android since the carefree times of Cupcake till the dawn of Tiramisu. And they are here to share tips and guides with users and developers on how to survive in these dark times.\n            \n            On Stardate 2020.7 we released a benchmark app to measure the level of dark practices different OEM-overlords use directly on the affected phones. And no later than Stardate 2022.7 we passed the force field of Google review process only to merge it directly into Android's source code within the CTS module - known as Compatibility Test Suite (or Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?).\n            \n            Now we (the developers from the Light side) can use this new Force to defend our apps. Every one of us can use the the Force of CTS-D (CTS-Defender Module) tests and even submit new tests and show the whole Galaxy who is killing apps and how!\n            \n            Viva la Resistance!\n            P.S. we also have cookies and a guitar song at the end!",

But where should you put your code to automate your CI/CD process?\n            \n            A simple bash script in your /tool directory is a good start, but to be honest: None of us is good at bash and nobody really wants to learn it. It doesn't scale, doesn't support dependencies and is not testable.\n            \n            Dart to the rescue! Sidekick generates a Dart command-line application for you. You can use the built-in command\n            \n            - `deps` gets all dependencies for all packages\n            - `gen` runs the build_runner, and formats the code afterwards\n            - `format` runs dart format across the project, ignores generated files.\n            \n            or use the project a starting point for you own commands to be shared with your team. Need some ideas?:\n            \n            - Automatically bump your version number\n            - Release your app to the Play Store / AWS / Firebase\n            - Generate a changelog based on the merged PRs\n            - Home-made build flavors: Switch between environments by editing and swapping of some files",
